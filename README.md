## Usage

Run a command by mentioning @nodeschoolbot in an issue comment, e.g. `@nodeschoolbot help`

* `help` - shows this help
* `create-repo {name}` - creates a nodeschool repo
* `add-user {username}` - adds a user to the `chapter-organizers` team and the org
* `create-team {team}` - creates a new team
* `add-team-user {team} {username}` - add a user to a specific team
* `create-chapter {name}` - creates a new chapter

## Run one yourself

```
nodeschoolbot --token={a-github-token} --secret={a-github-webhook-secret}
```

The token passed should have access to create repositories on nodeschool
and to add members to teams.

When setting up the webhook it only needs to forward issue comments
